# Project: Caesar Shifts

The basics:

    Goal: SWBAT use for loops over strings to implement Caesar Shifts.
    Timing: around 30 minutes

Implementation notes:

Going slowly here pays off. If students generate their own solutions to encoding and dealing with the problem of going past the end of the alphabet, they'll be much more comfortable moving on with confidence.

A possible approach here is to consider helper functions that encode a single letter. Either way, any technique that gives students time to think and plan before coding - working in partners, drafting pseudocode, anything like that - is a good idea.
